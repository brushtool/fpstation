  Borndeadman:
  - bugfix: Fixed cameras aboard the mining station causing interference between themselves
      and station bound cameras.
  - bugfix: Resume your regularly scheduled spying on your coworkers.
  - bugfix: Poppies no longer display UNKNOWN chemicals in them when viewed in the
      DNA Manipulator
  McBawbaggings:
  - rscadd: This guy did a million upmerges. I love him for that. - Yske
  Toxici11i:
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - rscadd: bluespace mining machines
  - rscdel: The SM no longer delaminates because it is over the critical threshold.
      This was bad.
  - tweak: The SM no longer also spawns pyroclastic anomalies (both because it annoys
      ghosts if an engineer does a meme build, and because it spawns hostile mobs
      and lots of them)
  Yske:
  - rscadd: We've had a little bit of a refurbishment here at Centcomm. We've thrown
      away the death squad armory because inspectors kept blowing up half our station
      to steal the contents, and replaced it with a RD bay, complete with autodoc
      and all the resources you could ever want. We've also installed a Mech bay for
      all our mechs which, while numerous, had no way to power themselves. This will
      allow ERT teams to a get a decent force multiplier in those situations that
      demand it. I'm sure nobody else will steal these, right?
  - tweak: borg light sprites fixed
  - rscadd: Replaced some never used, ugly borg sprites with brand spanking new ones.
      Thanks, kecko for spriting these.
  - soundadd: If this works, Youtube DL should be operational.
  - soundadd: all music is now server side aaa
  - rscadd: Put guns back in centcomm. This is a placeholder for now until we can
      get a actual nicer centcomm dock, but it should do.
  - rscadd: borg sounds are now fully added. thanks mcbawbaggin funny leg jiggle whatever
      your name is
  - tweak: techfab updated for bluespace mining
  - soundadd: Borgs now have unique death sounds per module to go with their screams.
      This is admin only for now until it's fully done.
  - rscadd: Uh oh. Adds a very stinky death sound on death with the use of a new clown
      implant.
  - tweak: Las gun does even 1.5 less damage now at the cost of over half the power
      draw as before. You can be shooting for days. The reason for this is because
      it seems to 2-4 each round, which when you use two of them, you've basically
      got a laser gun. A bit too spicy for me
  - tweak: Defender vest was nerfed hard due to it spawning a bit too much as well.
      It has less defense against bullets, and next to nothing against lasers. It's
      still better then nothing or makeshift armor, however.
  - rscdel: 'del: Wifebeater was deleted as Hippie ported them over themselves, no
      point having two of them.'
  - bugfix: should fix github not allowing travis stuff
  - soundadd: Borgs now have unique screams for modules.. This is only for admin spawned
      borgs for the time being, and is more of proof of concept right now, but stick
      with me on this.
  - bugfix: A bunch of screams were setup incorrectly and had the completely wrong
      speed. This is now fixed.
  - soundadd: Thanos now has a terrible new scream. I apologise.
  - soundadd: The Half Life Barney uniform now has screams.
  - tweak: ' Miller shoes now have less refrencey name to fit in with the other uniforms.'
  - rscadd: Replaces the Hippie sounds with new ones. Much better.
2020-02-19:
  Yske:
  - rscadd: Hey, Central here. We've found some older uniforms for security. We've
      put them in their respective lockers, since they're taking up valuable space
      here in our warehouse.
  - tweak: New borg sprites have been resized for balance.
  - rscadd: Ever since the clown got his licence revoked for wreckless driving, he's
      not had a fast way around the station. That changes now. Unicycle now spawns
      in his locker, which is extremely fast but neigh uncontrollable.
  - tweak: Nerf gun now costs ten TC due to it's long ass stun.
  - rscdel: My shitty snowflake self insert thingy has been removed from the loot
      table. Eat shit, Kiwi. It does spawn around, but you'll have to actively hunt
      for it.
2020-02-20: {}
2020-02-21:
  Weisyl:
  - tweak: Replaced cables on Lavaland to reflect TG's new mapping method for cables.
  - bugfix: Replaced a lot of incorrect turfs on Lavaland that were potential causes
      of pressure / atmos issues.
  - bugfix: Replaced a no-longer-existant exosuit fab on deltastation so that the
      git compiler will stop bitching about it.
  Yske:
  - rscadd: 'Central Command has deemed the usage of a new pet for the HOS an important
      topic. A dog has been dispatched. We hope this maybe curbs his violent, sociopath
      tendancies. '
  - tweak: Various typos and minor balance changes
  - rscadd: The soviet vending machine has been fixed after like two years. Whoops.
      You can find it in the russian room.
  - rscadd: A large father's armor has been abandoned in maintance. Apparently, it
      helps wards away ''casuls.''
  - rscadd: Syndicate base has been freshened up a little.

2019-11-04:

  - bugfix: Even more dynamic fixes
  Skoglol, TheChosenEvilOne:
  - rscadd: Dynamic now has a more threat based scaling of the individual solo antag
      modes, instead of only scaling amount of modes to threat. This should make for
      a somewhat less chaotic jumble of rulesets, with later picked ones supporting
      the initial one instead of overshadowing every time. Old style chaos still possible
      though.
  - admin: 'Dynamic: Configs now work.'

      of rolling instead of always doing so.'

      scaling off bomb armor. Heavy explosions still cause a ~2 second KO for follow
      up attacks.
  - balance: Devastating explosions now no longer gib players with more than 50 bomb
      armor. This used to be more or less random depending on the amount of bomb armor.
