It's better then nothing, right? This shuttle was transporting vermin and rodents to Central Command for their extremely large onboard zoo, but was condemned after all the subjects escaped. Since then, it's been sitting at dock. Some areas of this shuttle may not be up to our typical safety standards."

	description = "A cargo craft within your sector, known to be a salvage ship ran by a small pirate crew. Wanted dead for the pillaging of several civilian salvage ships within the past week. For a modest fee, we will \"guide\" them to the station so you may reclaim these goods for yourselves, in lieu of a standard escape shuttle. Do note, we expect seating to be minimal, and the stolen cargo is rumored to be of questionable origin."
